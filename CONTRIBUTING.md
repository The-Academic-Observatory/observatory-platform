# Contributing
Welcome to the contributing guide for the [academic-observatory](https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory)!
We welcome contributions to the project, please see below for details about how to contribute.

## Python
The academic-observatory is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

### Version
A minimum version of Python 3.7 is required.

### Code Style
The code style should conform to the Python [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Additional code style guidelines specific to this project include:
* Function parameters and return types should be annotated with [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
to make the API definition as clear as possible to end users of the library. The Python documentation page 
[typing â€” Support for type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) provides a good starting point for 
learning how to use type hints.
* A maximum line length of 120 characters.

A number of IDEs provide support for automatically formatting code so that it confirms to the PEP 8 specification. 
Guides for popular Python IDEs are listed below.
* Visual Studio Code with the [Microsoft Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): see [Linting Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting).
* PyCharm: see [Reformat and rearrange code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html).

### Documentation
Python docstrings should be written for all classes, methods and functions using the Sphinx docstring format. See the 
Sphinx tutorial [Writing docstrings](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html) for more 
details. Additional documentation style guidelines specific to this project include:

The instructions below show how to setup automatic docstring template generation with popular IDEs:
* Visual Studio Code: install the [autoDocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)
plugin. To enable docstrings to be generated in the Sphinx format, click Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions >
AutoDocstring Settings and from the `Docstring Format` dropdown, choose `sphinx`.
* PyCharm: PyCharm supports docstring generation out of the box, however, the Sphinx docstring format may need to be
explicitly specified. Click PyCharm > Preferences > Tools > Python Integrated Tools and under the Docstrings heading,
choose `reStructedText` from the `Docstring format` dropdown.

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are written with the [Python unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

The below code snippet is an example of a simple unit test. Create a class, in this example `TestString`, which
represents a batch of tests to implement (for instance all of the tests for a class). Implement tests for each
function as a new method beginning with `test_`, so that the Python unittest framework can find the methods
to test. For instance, the code snippet below tests the concatenation functionality for the Python String class in 
the function `test_concatenate`. See the [Python unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
documentation for more details.

```python
import unittest


class TestString(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_concatenate(self):
        expected = "hello world"
        actual = "hello" + " " + "world"
        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
```

Where to put the unit tests:
* The unit tests should be kept in the folder called `tests` at the root level of the project. The `tests` directory
mimics the folder structure of the `academic_observatory` Python package folder. For example, as illustrated in the
figure below, the tests for the code in the file `academic-observatory/academic_observatory/utils/ao_utils.py` are 
contained in the file `academic-observatory/tests/academic_observatory/utils/test_ao_utils.py`. 
* Small test datasets can be kept in the `academic-observatory/tests/data` folder, however, if the datasets are large 
they should be stored outside of git as it will make git operations such as cloning slow.
* The Python unittest framework looks for files named test*.py, so make sure to put "test_" at the start of your test
filename. For example, the unit tests for the file `ao_utils.py` are contained in the file called `test_ao_utils.py`.

An example of project and test directory structure:
```bash
|-- academic-observatory
    |-- .github
    |-- academic_observatory
        |-- scripts
        |-- telescopes
        |-- utils
            |-- __init__.py
            |-- ao_utils.py
            ...
        |-- __init__.py
    |-- tests
        |-- academic_observatory
            |-- scripts
            |-- telescopes
            |-- utils
                |-- __init__.py
                |-- test_ao_utils.py
                ...
            |-- __init__.py
        |-- data
        |-- __init__.py
    |-- .gitignore
    |-- CONTRIBUTING.md
    ...
```

To run the unittests from the command line, execute the following command from the root of the project, it should
automatically discover all of the unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest
```

How to enable popular IDEs to run the unittests:
* PyCharm: PyCharm supports test discovery and execution for the Python unittest framework. You may need to configure
PyCharm to use the unittest framework. Click PyCharm > Preferences > Tools > Python Integrated Tools and under the 
Testing heading, choose `Unittests` from the `Default test runner` dropdown.

## Development Workflow
This section explains the development workflow used in the academic-observatory project.

### Branches
The [academic-observatory](https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory) project has two main 
branches `master` and `develop`. The `master` branch contains the most up to date version of 
the code base running in production whilst the `develop` branch contains code that is ready to be delivered 
in the next release. The article [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
provides a much richer overview of this approach.

### Developing a feature
The general workflow for working on a feature is as follows:
1. Fork the [academic-observatory](https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory) project onto your
own Github profile.
2. Create a feature branch in your fork, branching off the `develop` branch.
3. Implement your feature.
4. Once your feature is ready, before making your pull request, make sure to [rebase](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase) 
your changes onto the latest `origin/develop` commit. 
5. Make your pull request.
* Tag a reviewer in the pull request, so that they receive a notification and know to review it.
* The guide on [How to write the perfect pull request](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/)
might be helpful.

Detailed instructions on how to use Git to accomplish this process are given below.

#### 1) Clone the project
Fork the Academic Observatory project on Github.

Clone your fork, with either HTTPS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your Github username]/academic-observatory.git
```

Or SSH (you need to setup an SSH keypair on Github for this to work):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:[your Github username]/academic-observatory.git
```

#### 2) Configure upstream
Make sure your are in the working directory of the project:
```bash
cd academic-observatory
```

Add the main Academic Observatory repository as upstream with either HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory.git
```

Or SSH:
```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory.git
```

#### 3) Sync your fork
Fetch the latest changes from origin and upstream:
```bash
git fetch --all
```

Checkout the local develop branch:
```bash
git checkout -b develop origin/develop
```

Merge the changes from upstream develop onto your local branch:
```bash
git merge upstream/develop
```

Git should just need to fast forward the changes, because we make our changes from feature branches.

See more details on the [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) Github page. 

#### 4) Create a feature branch
Checkout develop:
```bash
git checkout -b develop origin/develop
```

Then, create a new feature branch from develop:
```bash
git checkout -b <your-feature-name>
``` 

#### 5) Rebase
Checkout your feature branch:
```bash
git checkout <your-feature-name>
```

Rebase your feature branch (the branch currently checked out) onto develop.
```bash
git rebase -i develop
```

## Deployment (Maintainers Only)
This section contains information about how to deploy the project to PyPI and how to 
deploy updated documentation to Read the Docs (coming).

### Deploy to PyPI
Follow the instructions below to deploy the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

#### 1) Update setup.py and release on Github
In `setup.py` update `version` and `download_url` with the latest version number and the latest Github release download 
URL respectively:
```python
setup(
    version='19.12.0',
    download_url=('https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory/v19.12.0.tar.gz'
)
```

Commit these changes, push and make a new release on Github.

#### 2) Build the package
Enter the package folder:
```bash
cd academic-observatory
```

Ensure any dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a source distribution for the package:
```bash
python3 setup.py sdist
```

#### 3) Upload to PyPI
Install twine, which we will use to upload the release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):
```bash
pip3 install twine
```

Use twine to upload the release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):
```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

### Build and Deploy Documentation
This section explains how to build and deploy the documentation, which is contained in the `docs` directory.

Overview of the documentation:
* Generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).
* Theme: [sphinx-rtd-theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme).
* Documentation can be written in both Markdown and ReStructuredText text. Markdown is preferred and is parsed with
[recommonmark](https://github.com/readthedocs/recommonmark).
* API reference documentation is automatically generated from docstrings with [sphinx-autoapi](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-autoapi).

#### Building documentation
Navigate to the `docs` directory:
```bash
cd docs
```

Install the requirements for building the documentation:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build the documentation with the following command:
```bash
make html
```

The documentation should be generated in the `docs/_build` directory. You can open the file `docs_/build/index.html`
in a browser to preview what the documentation will look like.
