Reports
=================

The Reporting tool facilitates generating reports on data contained within the Academic Observatory.
Reports can be generated for data aggregated by countries or institutions, including summaries, data
comparisons, tables, and charts. The Reporting tool contains code elements to automate generating text
describing the report data. Reports can be output in multiple formats including PDF, and customised by
editing the code elements.
