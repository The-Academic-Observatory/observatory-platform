# GRID
“GRID has been developed by the team at Digital Science.” It is “a free, openly accessible 
database of research institution identifiers which enables users to make sense of their data. 
It does so by minimising the work required to link datasets together using a unique and 
persistent identifier.” GRID is “manually curated, offers geo-tagging and is an unbiased 
database of over 90,000 institutes.
