“Microsoft Academic (academic.microsoft.com) is a project exploring how to assist humans 
conducting scientific research” 
Semantics and AI learning are used to process documents discovered by a web crawler and 
extract scholarly entities and their relationships to form a knowledge base. The resulting 
Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is a “heterogeneous graph containing scientific publication 
records, citation relationships between those publications, as well as authors, institutions, 
journals, conferences, and fields of study.
