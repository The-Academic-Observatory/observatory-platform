Microsoft Academic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
“Microsoft Academic (academic.microsoft.com) is a project exploring how to assist humans
conducting scientific research.” Semantics and AI learning are used to process documents
discovered by a web crawler and extract scholarly entities and their relationships to form
a knowledge base. The resulting Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is a “heterogeneous graph
containing scientific publication records, citation relationships between those publications,
as well as authors, institutions, journals, conferences, and fields of study.”
