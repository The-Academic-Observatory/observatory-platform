# Observatory Platform Development Environment
The following is a tutorial for running the local Observatory Platform development environment.

Make sure that you have followed the installation instructions to install the Observatory Platform on your system.

## Prepare configuration files
Generate a config.yaml file:
```bash
observatory generate config.yaml
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
The file "/home/user/.observatory/config.yaml" exists, do you want to overwrite it? [y/N]: y
config.yaml saved to: "/home/user/.observatory/config.yaml"
Please customise the parameters with '<--' in the config file. Parameters with '#' are optional.
```

See [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) for more 
details on creating a project and [Getting Started with Authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for 
instructions on how to create a service account key.

Parameters explained: 
```yaml
backend: The backend of the config file, either 'local' or 'terraform'.
fernet_key: The fernet key which is used to encrypt the secrets in the airflow database 
google_application_credentials: The path to the JSON key for a Google Cloud service account that has permissions
airflow_connections:

## Running the local development environment
See below for instructions on how to start the Observatory Platform, view Observatory Platform UIs, stop the 
Observatory Platform and customise other settings. 

### Start the Observatory Platform
To start the local Observatory Platform development environment:

...
Observatory Platform: stopped                                                   
```

### Specify a config.yaml file
To specify a different config.yaml file use the `--config-path` parameter when starting the Observatory Platform:
```bash
observatory platform start --config-path /your/path/to/config.yaml
```

### Specify a DAGs folder
To specify a different dags folder use the `--dags-path` parameter when starting the Observatory Platform:

```

### Specify a data folder
To specify a different folder to mount as the host machine's data folder, use the `--data-path` parameter when 
starting the Observatory Platform:
```bash
observatory platform start --data-path /your/path/to/data
```

### Specify a logs folder
To specify a different folder to mount as the host machine's logs folder, use the `--logs-path` parameter when 
starting the Observatory Platform:
```bash
observatory platform start --logs-path /your/path/to/logs
```

### Specify a PostgreSQL folder
To specify a different folder to mount as the host machine's PostgreSQL data folder, use the `--postgres-path` parameter 
when starting the Observatory Platform:
```bash
observatory platform start --postgres-path /your/path/to/postgres
```

### Specify a user id

```

# Observatory Terraform Environment
The following is a tutorial for setting up the Observatory Terraform environment.


## Prepare configuration files
Generate an individual config_terraform.yaml file for each terraform workspace:
```bash
observatory generate config_terraform.yaml
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
The file "/home/user/.observatory/config_terraform.yaml" exists, do you want to overwrite it? [y/N]: y
config.yaml saved to: "/home/user/.observatory/config.yaml"
Please customise the parameters with '<--' in the config file. Parameters with '#' are optional.
```

## Creating and updating Terraform workspaces
See below for instructions on how to run observatory terraform create-workspace and update-workspace.

### Terraform credentials
To create a workspace you need a token that is linked to your Terraform Cloud user account.  
Create token and login on Terraform Cloud:
```bash
terraform login
```

This should automatically store the token in `/home/user/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json`, this file is used during 
the next commands to retrieve the token.  

It's also possible to explicitly set the path to the credentials file using the option '--terraform-credentials-file'.

### Terraform variables.tf
To validate the variables in the config file they are compared with the variables in your Terraform variables.tf file.
The default path for the variables.tf file is relative to the observatory platform package location. For example if 
`/home/user/workspace/observatory-platform` is the location of your observatory platform installation, the path to variables.tf 
will be set to `/home/user/workspace/observatory-platform/terraform/variables.tf`.  

It's possible to explicitly set the path to the variables.tf file using the option '--terraform-variables-path'

### Adjusting verbosity of Terraform API
The level of logging output from the Terraform API can be set by adjusting the '-v' option from nothing to max '-vv'.

### Observatory Platform Terraform create-workspace
To create a new workspace in Terraform Cloud:
```bash
observatory terraform create-workspace /home/user/.observatory/config_terraform.yaml
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
Observatory Terraform: all dependencies found                                   
  Terraform variables.tf file:
   - path: /home/user/workspace/observatory-platform/terraform/variables.tf
  Config:
   - path: /home/user/.observatory/config_terraform.yaml
   - file valid
  Terraform credentials file:
   - path: /home/user/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json

Terraform Cloud Workspace: 
  Organization: your-organization
  - Name: observatory-dev (prefix: 'observatory-' + suffix: 'dev')
  - Settings: 
   - Auto apply: True
   - Terraform Cloud Version: 0.13.0-beta3

### Observatory Platform Terraform update-workspace
To update variables in an existing workspace in Terraform Cloud:
```bash
observatory terraform update-workspace /home/user/.observatory/config_terraform.yaml
```

Depending on which variables are updated, you should see output similar to this:
```bash
Observatory Terraform: all dependencies found                                   
  Terraform variables.tf file:
   - path: /home/user/workspace/observatory-platform/terraform/variables.tf
