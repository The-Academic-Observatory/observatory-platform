    Mainly provided for future development to provide any general
    methods or objects required for Observatory Charts.

    All chart methods are required to implement a `process_data` and
    `plot` method. The first conducts any filtering or reshaping of
    the data and the second plots with defaults. In general
    the init method should place the relevant data as a pd.DataFrame
    in self.df and the `process_data` method should modify this in
    place.

    The plot method should accept an ax argument which defaults to
    None. The default behaviour should be to create and return a
    matplotlib figure. Arguments for modifying either the ax or
    the figure should be accepted and passed to the correct object,
    generally after construction.
