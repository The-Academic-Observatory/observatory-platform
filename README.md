![Observatory Platform](./logo.jpg?raw=true)

The Observatory Platform is an environment for fetching, processing and analysing data to understand how well 
universities operate as Open Knowledge Institutions. 

The Observatory Platform is built with Apache Airflow and includes DAGs (workflows) for processing: Crossref Metadata, 
Fundref, GRID, Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and Unpaywall.

```
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

Install Docker Desktop:
* Follow the [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) tutorial.

### Installing the Observatory Platform
Make sure that you have followed the above instructions for installing the observatory-platform dependencies,
for your respective platform.

Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/observatory-platform
```

Enter the `observatory-platform` directory:
```bash
cd observatory-platform
```

Checkout the develop branch:
```
git checkout develop
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
virtualenv -p python3.7 venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the package:
```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

## Observatory Platform development environment

### Prepare configuration files
Generate a config.yaml file:
```bash
observatory generate config.yaml
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
The file "/home/user/.observatory/config.yaml" exists, do you want to overwrite it? [y/N]: y
config.yaml saved to: "/home/user/.observatory/config.yaml"
Please customise the following parameters in config.yaml:
  - project_id
  - data_location
  - download_bucket_name
  - transform_bucket_name
  - google_application_credentials
```

The following parameters in the generated config.yaml need to be customised:
* project_id: a Google Cloud project id. See 
[Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) for more 
details.
* data_location: the location where BigQuery data will be stored (same as the bucket location).
* download_bucket_name: the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket where downloaded data will be stored.
* transform_bucket_name: the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket where transformed data will be stored.
* google_application_credentials: the path to the JSON key for a Google Cloud service account that has permissions
to access the two buckets and the roles `roles/bigquery.admin` and `roles/storagetransfer.admin`.
See [Getting Started with Authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for 
instructions on how to create a service account key.

### Start the Observatory Platform
